# Vue-project
What could become a desktop app, for myself.

This is a project containing the following frameworks/libraries:

* Vue.js for the front end
* Bulma CSS framework for the styling, used mostly with sass
* Laravel for the back end, in the future instead of Lavarel I'll use Lumen, a ligther alternative with the same functionality

Inside this project you will find aspects that adhere to the **CRUD** principles (Create Read Update Delete), such as:

* A list that contains video game titles and the ability to add them
* A list of Recipes presented in a very modern and stylish container
* A list of websites related to gastronomy
