          <p>This is a website that contains things I probably like and things that are currently in my mind, this is also a way to 
          record things I may forget, like a storage room.</p>

          <p>I made this because I was bored and wanted to create a multipage website... And because I think I'm depressed.</p>

          <p>It contains mostly a bunch of lists, it could also contain some definitions or notes I prefer to save inside this website
          for readability. The lists fall under these categories:</p>

          <h2>Cooking</h2>
          <p>Cooking has been a passion for me since I was 12, don't forget that, but due to laziness and the situation 
          of the country my ability to practice good gastronomy has been limited, but still, that has never stopped my 
          curiosity for it, when I had free time I liked to investigate the science behind cooking and recipes I could 
          afford, they weren't many but they brought me happiness nonetheless.</p>

          <p>In this category I will post recipes I like (some of which I might have created) or images containing
          information about spice combinations, herb data, etc.</p>

          <h2>Video Games</h2>
          <p>This category doesn't need an explanation, lately I've been playing just one game, Super Smash Bros Melee, this game 
          requires high skill for competitive play, which is probably the reason I play it. As a child I've always been 
          good with video games, so it was a matter of time until I found myself bored at "easy" games, so currently 
          I mostly play games with a good history or high difficulty.</p>

          <p>In this category I will post video game titles I liked in the past, and probably my experience with them.</p>

          <h2>Programming</h2>
          <p>Programming is something I wish I knew how to do at a very young age, I have loved programming since 
          I started seeing it on my first semester of Telecomunications and lately I found that I'm constantly improving 
          step by step whenever I have free time, however I usually spend my time programming inside my comfort zone, 
          what I mean with this is that on hobby projects I don't try to use new techniques but instead use old knowledge. 
          This is a habit I'm trying to leave behind.</p>

          <p>This category will be about strict learning, it could contain books about progamming, little tips about things 
          one could forget between programming languages, web-development, etc.</p>
